During my data science internship, I worked on several projects, including: Movie Rating Prediction, IRIS Flower Classification, Credit Card Fraud Detection. 

Movie Rating Prediction: I developed a model to predict movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors. This involved analyzing historical movie data, performing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models to estimate the ratings accurately.

IRIS Flower Classification: I created a classification model to identify different species of IRIS flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions. This project helped me understand various classification algorithms and techniques for evaluating model performance.

Credit Card Fraud Detection: I built a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using historical transaction data. The project involved handling imbalanced datasets, applying various feature selection methods, and implementing machine learning algorithms to accurately identify potential frauds.
